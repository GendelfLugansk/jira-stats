            <p>This application has been created to analyze JIRA issues, mainly logged time/estimates</p>
            <p>How to use:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                In JIRA:
                <ol>
                  <li>Go to the board or project you wish to export</li>
                  <li>On the left side, click on Issues and filters</li>
                  <li>Click "Advanced search"</li>
                  <li>Apply filters if you want</li>
                  <li>On the top right of your screen, click on the "Export" drop down (second icon from the right).
                  </li>
                  <li>Save file to your PC</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                In this app:
                <ol>
                  <li>Navigate to Import</li>
                  <li>Import your file</li>
                  <li>Now you can go to List of issues or report</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>App will not work if you have language different from "English (USA)" in personal JIRA
            settings &mdash; this leads to translated column headers in CSV</strong></p>

            <h4>Performance</h4>

            <p>App was tested on file containing 1000 issues and on that amount performance is good. I didn't
            test it with larger amounts. As a precaution, amount of issue this app can process is limited to 50000</p>

            <h4>Data Persistence & Security concerns</h4>

            <p>This application stores your data in your browser, in indexedDB. Therefore, data is accessible
            to people who can access your PC</p>

            <p>If you want to remove all stored data &mdash; click "Drop Database" in user menu (it's under user name!)
              in left navigation panel</p>
